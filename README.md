# Faction Scoreboard
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Faction Scoreboard is a Minecraft Spigot/Paper server plugin that integrates with Factions plugins to display claimed land in nearby chunks using Minecraft's Scoreboard feature. This allows a quick view of the Faction Map without having to run the corresponding faction map command. It updates live as the player moves from chunk to chunk, and can be disabled if the player doesn't wish to see it on their screen.

This particular fork has been updated to support Factions V3 which was a fork of MassiveCraft's Factions V2 (the original creators of the original Factions plugin).

## Current Faction Plugins Supported
* Factions V3 (MassiveCraft Factions V2 Fork)

(Other faction plugin support may be added back in at a later time.)
